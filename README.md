## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass compiler


### What I learned

Through this project I have learnt application of Sass to a project markup.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```


### Continued development

Areas for development are sass markup to make the project cleaner and leaner.
